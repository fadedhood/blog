# 🚀 Custom Cybersecurity-Themed Hugo Blog

I have created a **custom cybersecurity-themed Hugo blog website**, originally forked from [hugo-winston-theme](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme). It has been fully customized and transformed into a cybersecurity theme. 

This template is **ready to use**—no Hugo setup required! You can see a **live demo** here: [FadedHood Blog](https://blog.fadedhood.com). Below is the **GitHub template** for setting up your own blog:

```bash
https://github.com/anonfaded/hugo-winston-cyber
```

Open the above link to access the GitHub template, and follow the steps below to get your website live within minutes.

## ✍️ Managing Blog Content

### 📂 Post Management
- Blog posts are located in the `content/posts` folder.
- You can edit, delete, or create new Markdown (`.md`) files for your posts.

### 🖼️ Managing Images
- Store images in the `static/images` folder.

### 🌍 Customizing Social Media Preview Image (OG Image)
1. Design a custom **Open Graph (OG) image** (800x420px recommended).
2. Replace the existing one at `static/images/og-image-webp.webp`, and remember to name it exactly as `og-image-webp.webp`
3. A free **Photoshop PSD template** is available at `static/psd/og-image.psd`, which you can customize for yourself by replacing the placeholder text.
4. If you don’t have Photoshop (even if you have), use [Photopea](https://photopea.com) instead, a free online alternative which have all the features of Photoshop, and also it's online browser based, without the need to download anything. (This default template was designed using Photopea as well)

  - `twitter_handle`
  - `github_username`
  - `kofi_username`
